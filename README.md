# Python for Data Analysis 

* This project is done by Nada MATROUF and Jihane OUL ALI. It contains a data analysis on the â€˜obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions data set provided by Fabio Mendoza Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas. 
## Content
The project deliverables can be divided into 4 parts: 
A powerpoint PDF showcasing the steps taken, the questions that are responded, the developed variables etc. 
A Jupyter Notebook (Python) containing the data  visualization part of the dataset.
A Jupyter Notebook (Python) containing the modelization part of the dataset.
A flask API that can run the previously created model with an exemple. 
## Introduction
The dataset is thoroughly described in the PowerPoint. I recommend reading that first in order to understand the dataset that will be studied. 
## Visualization and modelization 
The Jupyter notebook shows the visualization of the dataset and the two created models.
The first model is created without the height and weight attributes while the second model is created with those attributes.
Three different Machine Learning algorithm are tested for each dataset:
- Decision tree Model
- Random Forest Model
- KNN Model

At the end the Random Forest has been chosen as it was the model with the highest accuracy. 

## API flask
In the API folder,  an API can be found using Flask.  You can test it using the request.py
