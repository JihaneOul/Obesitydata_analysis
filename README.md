# Python for Data Analysis 

* This project is done by Nada MATROUF and Jihane OUL ALI. It contains a data analysis on the ‘obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions data set provided by Fabio Mendoza Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas. *
## Content
The project deliverables can be divided into 4 parts: 
A powerpoint PDF showcasing the steps taken, the questions that are responded, the developed variables etc. 
A Jupyter Notebook (Python) containing the data  visualization part of the dataset.
A Jupyter Notebook (Python) containing the modelization part of the dataset.
A flask API that can run the previously created model with an exemple. 
## Introduction
The dataset is thoroughly described in the PowerPoint. I recommend reading that first in order to understand the dataset that will be studied. 
## Visualization and modelization 
The two Jupyter notebooks show how the visualization and modelization of the dataset are performed. We used : -- The accuracy that we had was around : ---

## API flask
In the API folder,  an API can be found using Flask.  In order to run this open the obesity.csv you can add some lines to it. Run the app.py in the terminal and run the API_client in another terminal. The results will be saved in obestity_predictions.csv and the accuracy is printed.
